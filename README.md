# GetAround Car Rental Service Project  🚗 🚗 🚗
## Overview 🌐
GetAround is an online car rental service operating much like Airbnb for cars. Founded in 2009, the platform has experienced rapid growth, boasting over 5 million users and about 20,000 available cars worldwide by 2019. Users must complete a check-in and check-out flow at the beginning and end of each rental for several purposes:

1.Assess the condition of the car and report any pre-existing or new damages.
2.Compare fuel levels before and after rental.
3.Measure the distance driven during the rental period.

# Project Goals 🎯
## Primary Goals
**Implement Minimum Delay**: To address issues related to late returns, a minimum delay will be set between two consecutive rentals for the same car.
**Decisions Pending**: Minimum delay duration, scope of application (all cars, only Connect cars, etc.)
**Rental Price Prediction**: Provide an API with a /predict endpoint that estimates the rental price per day.

## Secondary Goals
Analyze the impact of implementing the minimum delay feature on owner's revenue and user experience.
Determine the frequency and impact of late check-ins and checkouts.

## API
This is an app which **predicts car rental prices based on certain parameters**.
These are the parameters : car model's name, mileage, engine_power, fuel, car_type, as well an aviability of following features : private parking, gps, has_air_conditioning, automatic_car, has_getaround_connect, has_speed_regulator, winter_tires.

User can either **fill in the fields** or make request by **posting data in json format**.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning was implemented in Colab Notebook. 
Several  models have been tried: **Multivariate  Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Descision Tree and XGBoost**.
Their metrics have been analysed and the **importance of coeficients has been compared**. Based on this analysis, the chosen model was a **Multivariate Linear Regression Model**. This is the model which is used in the API.

The full code is available in this repository.
