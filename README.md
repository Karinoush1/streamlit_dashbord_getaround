# Part 1 : Streamlit Dashboard 
## Overview 🌐
GetAround is an online car rental service operating much like Airbnb for cars. Founded in 2009, the platform has experienced rapid growth, boasting over 5 million users and about 20,000 available cars worldwide by 2019.

# Project Goals : Get insights and improve customer and owner happiness.

**Implement Minimum Delay**: To address issues related to late returns, a minimum delay will be set between two consecutive rentals for the same car.
**Decisions Pending**: Minimum delay duration, scope of application (all cars, only Connect cars, etc.)
**Analyze the impact** of implementing the minimum delay feature on owner's revenue and user experience.
**Determine the frequency** and impact of late check-ins and checkouts.
